Introduction
"
Saphire: Theorems are important to prove anything in lean. Even the simpliest theorem require a multitude of therorems to prove that theorem.
We are going to use simple theorems, and make simple proofs that in which will be used in a later world.
When you use a tactic, lean `apply`s a multitude of subsequent proofs to it.
You can just use apply to finish every single goal.
So for right now, we will be only using `apply` to prove proofs.
