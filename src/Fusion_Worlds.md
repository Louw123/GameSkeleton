## What are Fusion worlds

Worlds use proofs to solve theorems. They can be self-contained.
When a world depends on two other worlds, then the world is a fusion world.
Fusion worlds are less limiting than normal worlds, both for the author of the world and the player because it helps with solving the proofs.

Fusion worlds can increase the intricacy of the proof by proving more complicated concepts.

To make a Fusion world you must be placed the file in the specific fusion folder as seen here:\
F2 - fusion of two worlds
F3 - fusion of three worlds
F3 - fusion of four worlds
