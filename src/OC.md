# How Gemsonas are handled.
If you want to use a Gemsona in this game, you must have an image of your Gemsona and the name of Your Gemsona.
The world must have a concept that can be proven and be used in multiple statements.

If your concept depends on other Tactics, and/or Theorems, then the Gemsona must be a fusion.
See (Fusion worlds)[Fusion_Worlds.md]

You can fuse your world's staments with others to create a new world with the previous rules applied.
