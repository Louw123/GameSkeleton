# Game

## description

The game is based on a series called Steven Universe. A show about a gem named Steven with Garnet (Ruby and saphire), Amethyst, and Pearl. This game takes elements of the series and with the lean Theorem Prover to make into a cohesive story. After Steven left the crystal gems, garnet, amethyst, pearl and Steven begin to prove statements in the lean theorem Prover.

The game starts off with the introduction of tactics and theorems, the expanding on the basic concepts in lean. Then those concepts combine with other concepts to prove more advanced concepts.

## File structure
The file/world structure is structured like this:
```
F2:
  F3:
    F4:
      Obsidian
    Alexandrite
  Opal
  Sugilite
  Sardonyx
  Sunstone
  Rainbow
  Smoky Quartz
Ruby
Sapphire
Garnet
Amethyst
Pearl
Steven
```
Here are the concepts mentioned in each world:
```

F2:
  F3:
    F4:
      Obsidian - functional proofs
    Alexandrite - Non-functional proofs
  Opal - Advanced set theory proofs
  Sugilite - Natural number proofs
  Sardonyx - non-equality proofs (extension of Steven's world)
  Sunstone - Generating proofs for creating algorithm using decide
  Rainbow - Functions with logic proofs
  Smoky Quartz - functions with sets proofs

Ruby - Tactics
Sapphire - Theorems
Garnet - arithmetic
Amethyst - set theory
Pearl - logic
Steven - functions
```
> Note: It could be considered that ruby and Sapphire is for F1 and garnet and the rest of the gems be in F2. However, it will not make any sense for the tactics and theorems must be shown before simple arithmetic.
